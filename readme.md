This a Demo app for my fullstack academy stackathon. To use this app npm install it in your environment. You must also create a .env file and add a riot API key in order to pull stats from the Riot API. Due to the limitations of the Riot API keys I can not provide my key for others to use. A development key can be easily obtained with a league of legends account. checkout more information here: https://developer.riotgames.com/apis
